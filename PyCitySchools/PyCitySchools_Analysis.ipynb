    "-   The data reveals that, on the whole, smaller populated schools, predominantly Charter Schools, \n",
    "    outperformed their larger populated counterparts, which were Public District schools. \n",
    "    Although the Charter Schools exhibited superior performance across all categories examined when       compared to the District Public schools, \n",
    "    it is important to note that the sample size of the data may not be sufficient to establish a         definitive conclusion regarding their academic superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The correlation between school funding and academic performance was found to be inconclusive, as       per the spending summary analysis.  \n",
    "    Surprisingly,students with lower per student budgets exhibited superior performance compared to       those with larger per student budgets. \n",
    "    This finding highlights the need for decision makers to consider not just the amount of funds         allocated to schools, but also how those funds are utilized to achieve desired outcomes. Merely       spending more per student does not guarantee success or excellence. \n",
    "    It underscores the importance of prudent budget utilization to optimize educational outcomes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Moreover, the analysis of school data indicates that students, on average, are performing             significantly better in Reading as compared to Math. Across all categories, students achieved         higher scores in Reading, suggesting that Math may be perceived as more challenging. \n",
    "    This underscores the need for increased emphasis on promoting Math excellence through enhanced         encouragement and additional resources to foster proficiency in this subject area."
